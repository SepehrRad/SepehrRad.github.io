The aim of this project was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the yellow cab industry in New York. Furthermore, using the open-source NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) data in 2020 the project aims to unfold opportunities and recommendations to the industry.

The project was divided into two main parts. In the first section, the EDA part, all trips were interactively visualized using Panel and multiple visualization libraries. (E.g. Plotly, Folium)

The explanatory analysis showed the taxi hot zones as well as the impact of Covid-19 on public mobility:

In the second section, the prediction modeling part, three models were built to predict fare amount, expected trip distance, and payment type. The apparent effect of covid-19 was taken into account by engineering an array of relevant features such as covid-19 lockdowns timeline as well as school restrictions. The Random Forest Classifier and Regressor were built using the XGBoost library and fine-tuned using grid search:

| Model | Prediction Target | Evaluation Metric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Random Forest Classifier` | Payment Type | 0.88 Percision     0.81 F1 |
| `Random Forest Regressor` | Fare Amount ($) | 0.385 MAE     1.289 RMSE |
| `Random Forest Regressor` | Trip Distance (KM) | 0.407 MAE  0.665 RMSE |
